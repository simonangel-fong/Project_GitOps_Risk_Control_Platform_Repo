# GitOps Canary Promotion

**End to End. Auto-Promoted. Canary-Released**

> A production-style GitOps project that separates application, infrastructure, and platform delivery across 3 repositories. <br>
> It uses EKS, ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, Terraform, and GitHub Actions to automate environment-based deployments, canary promotion, rollback, and post-deployment monitoring and alerting.

## 1. Why This Project Exists

### 1.1 Managing App, Infrastructure, and Platform Changes

**Challenge:**

- In enterprise environments, _application code_, _cloud infrastructure_, and _Kubernetes platform configuration_ are often owned by different roles.
- Without clear separation and automated GitOps workflows, delivery can become slow, inconsistent, and difficult to audit.

**Solution:**

- This project uses a `3-repo GitOps strategy` to separate application, infrastructure, and platform responsibilities.
- `CI/CD pipelines` automate validation, image delivery, infrastructure provisioning, and manifest updates, making the delivery process more traceable and repeatable.

---

### 1.2 Releasing Safely Without Business Interruption

**Challenge:**

- Direct production releases increase the risk of downtime, failed deployments, and slow recovery.
- Without a controlled deployment strategy, issues may only be detected after they affect users.

**Solution:**

- This project implements `canary deployment` across isolated `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` environments.
- `Argo Rollouts`, automated analysis, monitoring, and rollback logic help detect issues early, reduce release risk, and protect business continuity.

---

## 2. Project Architecture

- 3-repo GitOps model to separate application delivery, infrastructure provisioning, and platform configuration.

## 3. What This Platform Repo Manages

This **platform repo** acts as the `GitOps control plane` for the project after the `EKS cluster` and `ArgoCD` are provisioned by the infrastructure repo.

It manages

- Kubernetes application manifests,
- ArgoCD App-of-Apps bootstrap resources,
- platform add-ons,
- environment overlays,
- canary rollout definitions,
- external secrets integration,
- monitoring configuration,
- and notification workflows.

The repository is organized around GitOps ownership, environment separation, and reusable automation:

### 3.1 Canary Deployment and Auto Rollback

`Canary deployment` reduces release risk by gradually shifting traffic to a new version, validating application health, and rolling back automatically before a bad release affects all users.

This project uses `Argo Rollouts`, `AnalysisTemplates`, `Prometheus metrics`, and `Slack notifications` to automate **canary promotion**, **failure detection**, **rollback**, and **release visibility**.

```text
New Image / Manifest Update
        v
ArgoCD Syncs Rollout Manifest
        v
Argo Rollouts Starts Canary Release
        v
Shift Small Portion of Traffic to New Version
        v
Run AnalysisTemplate Checks
        +----------------------------+
        v                            v
Metrics Healthy                Metrics Failed
        v                            v
Promote New Version            Roll Back to Stable Version
        v                            v
Send Slack Notification        Send Slack Notification
```

---

#### Scenario Demo: Happy path promotion

- A new version passes analysis, traffic is gradually promoted, and `Slack` receives the deployment result.

![canary-happy-path](docs/assets/canary-happy-path.gif)

---

#### Scenario Demo: Failure rollback on DB connection error

- A bad release fails health/metric validation, `Argo Rollouts` rolls back to the stable version, and `Slack` receives the rollback notification.

For the full walkthrough, see [docs/canary_demo.md](docs/canary_demo.md).

### 3.2 Deployment Control with ArgoCD Sync Waves

Application resources depend on platform services such as secrets, ingress, DNS, rollout controllers, and monitoring, so deployment order must be controlled.

This repo uses `ArgoCD Sync Waves` to deploy resources layer by layer:

- lower wave numbers run first
- higher wave numbers run later.

ArgoCD Sync Wave Deployment Order:

```text
Wave 110  ── External Secrets Operator
              v
Wave 120  ── Karpenter
              v
Wave 200  ── AWS Load Balancer Controller
              v
Wave 210  ── Envoy Gateway
              v
Wave 220  ── ExternalDNS
              v
Wave 500  ── Argo Rollouts
              v
Wave 600  ── Prometheus Stack
              v
Wave 900  ── Backend Application
              v
Wave 910  ── Frontend Application
```

---

### 3.3 Automated CI/CD Pipelines and Promotion Flow

This project creates `automated CI/CD pipelines` to **validate platform changes**, **promote manifests across environments**, and **keep production releases approval-based**.

| Env     | Owner / Trigger                                           | Jobs Automated by Pipeline                                                                                          |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | _Platform Engineer_ commits manifest changes              | Manifest lint check, security scan, GitOps sync, smoke test, failure notification                                   |
| `stage` | Auto-promotion after dev validation                       | Promote manifests to stage, GitOps sync, load test, validation notification                                         |
| `prod`  | _Release Owner_ reviews and approves production promotion | Promote manifests to prod, GitOps sync, release notification, post-deployment monitoring, Alertmanager notification |

- The pipeline keeps `dev` and `stage` highly automated for fast validation,
- The `prod` requires human release approval to protect production stability.

---

### 3.4 Environment Strategy

- This project **separates** `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` to support fast validation, production-like testing, and controlled production release.
- Each environment is protected by dedicated `git branch`, `cluster`, and `Kustomize configuration`, to ensure changes can move through the delivery flow **with lower risk**.

| Env     | Branch  | Cluster        | Manifest Path     | Purpose                                            | Feature                            |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | `dev`   | `gitops-dev`   | `overlays/dev/`   | Safe space for development and early validation    | Flexible, fast-changing            |
| `stage` | `stage` | `gitops-stage` | `overlays/stage/` | Production-like environment for release validation | Test-heavy, production-like        |
| `prod`  | `prod`  | `gitops-prod`  | `overlays/prod/`  | Live environment for end users                     | Stable, reliable, security-focused |

- [Debugging `Slack Notifications`](docs/debug_argo_notification.md): Slack notification setup and common issues for ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts

---

## 5. Limitations

This project focuses on GitOps delivery design, canary promotion, and platform automation. Some production-grade areas can be improved further:

- Separate clusters improve isolation but _increase operational cost and management overhead_.
  - **Improvement**: Add cost controls, shared platform modules, and automated cleanup for non-prod environments.
- Canary rollback depends on _selected health checks and metrics(pod readiness)_.
  - **Improvement**: Expand analysis with stronger SLO-based metrics such as error rate, latency, saturation, and business-level signals.
- Production promotion still requires _manual approval_.
  - **Improvement**: Integrate richer release evidence, approval history, and change-management records before production deployment.
- The project demonstrates platform automation but does not _cover full disaster recovery_.
  - **Improvement**: Add backup, restore, multi-AZ / multi-region failover testing, and recovery runbooks.
