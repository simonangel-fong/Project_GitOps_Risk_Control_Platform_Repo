# Canary Deployment Design — Dev → Stage

## Purpose

Demonstrate Argo Rollouts as a progressive-delivery filter across two environments, using one image and three failure scenarios. Show _which layer_ catches _which bug class_, and where canary's limits are.

This document is the design contract for the build. A diagram of the full vision (including the unbuilt prod tier, soak gate, and alerting) is referenced at the end and lives separately.

## The matrix

| Scenario                         | Env   | Bug                      | Canary config                                        | Catching layer                               | Outcome                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Baseline                      | dev   | none                     | 25/50/100, 60s pauses                                | n/a                                          | Promotes cleanly                                                             |
| 2. RDS connection failure        | dev   | bug 1                    | 25/50/100, 60s pauses                                | `readinessProbe` + `progressDeadlineSeconds` | Pod never Ready → rollout aborts during 25% step                             |
| 3a. Subtle OOM — escapes dev     | dev   | bug 2                    | 25/50/100, 60s pauses                                | none — bug outlasts canary window            | Rollout completes; pods OOM post-promotion; manual recovery via `git revert` |
| 3b. Subtle OOM — caught in stage | stage | bug 2 (same image as 3a) | 25/50/100, 10min pauses + AnalysisTemplate on memory | AnalysisTemplate (Prometheus memory query)   | Memory climbs during 25% step → analysis fails → auto-rollback               |

One image. Two overlays. Three runs. Each scenario exercises a distinct catching mechanism.

## Thesis

Canary is a filter, not a guarantee. Whether a bug is caught depends on whether the canary window outlasts the bug's incubation period. Scenarios 3a and 3b are the same bug, same image — only the gate length differs, and the outcome flips. That is the point.

## Bug definitions

### Bug 1 — RDS connection failure

- Trigger: env var `DB_HOST` pointed at an unreachable host (or `DB_PASSWORD` wrong).
- Symptom: Spring Boot fails to start the connection pool, `/api/health` returns 500 or pod fails to bind port.
- Manifests as: readinessProbe fails on every new pod.
- Catching layer: Kubernetes readiness + Argo Rollouts `progressDeadlineSeconds`. AnalysisTemplate is _not needed_ — canary pods never become Ready, so the rollout cannot progress.

### Bug 2 — Subtle OOM

- Trigger: env vars `IS_OOM=true` and `OOM_AFTER_MINUTE=N` on the Spring Boot app.
- Behavior: app starts and serves traffic normally. After N minutes, allocates past the 256Mi container limit → OOMKilled → restarts → OOMs again → CrashLoopBackOff.
- Catching layer depends on canary window length:
  - **Window < OOM_AFTER_MINUTE** (dev, 60s pauses) → rollout completes before OOM fires. Bug escapes.
  - **Window > OOM_AFTER_MINUTE** (stage, 10min pauses) → OOM fires while canary pod is serving 25% of traffic. AnalysisTemplate sees memory spike or pod restart and aborts.

## Argo Rollouts configuration

### Dev — fast canary

```yaml
strategy:
  canary:
    steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause: { duration: 60s }
      - setWeight: 50
      - pause: { duration: 60s }
      - setWeight: 100
progressDeadlineSeconds: 120
progressDeadlineAbort: true
```

- Total rollout time: ~3 min.
- `progressDeadlineSeconds: 120` aborts if a canary pod isn't Ready within 2 min — this is what catches bug 1.
- No AnalysisTemplate. Dev is fast and accepts that delayed bugs may slip through. That is the design trade.

### Stage — long canary + analysis

```yaml
strategy:
  canary:
    steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause: { duration: 10m }
      - analysis:
          templates:
            - templateName: backend-memory-health
      - setWeight: 50
      - pause: { duration: 10m }
      - analysis:
          templates:
            - templateName: backend-memory-health
      - setWeight: 100
progressDeadlineSeconds: 900
progressDeadlineAbort: true
```

- Total rollout time: ~20 min if it completes.
- Bug 2's OOM (configured to fire at ~3 min) lands well inside the 10-min canary window.
- AnalysisTemplate runs after each pause and aborts on failure.

### AnalysisTemplate (stage only)

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: backend-memory-health
  namespace: backend
spec:
  metrics:
    - name: pod-restart-count
      interval: 60s
      count: 3
      successCondition: result[0] == 0
      failureLimit: 1
      provider:
        prometheus:
          address: http://prometheus-server.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090
          query: |
            sum(increase(
              kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{
                namespace="backend",
                pod=~"gitops-backend-.*"
              }[2m]
            ))
```

- Single metric: container restart count in the last 2 minutes.
- An OOMKill produces a restart. One restart in the canary window = analysis fails.
- Memory-utilization query was considered but rejected: noisier, requires tuning a threshold, and the restart signal is unambiguous.

## Where the env vars live

All bug-control env vars live in [apps/backend/base/20_rollout.yaml](apps/backend/base/20_rollout.yaml) with safe defaults:

```yaml
env:
  - name: IS_OOM
    value: "false"
  - name: OOM_AFTER_MINUTE
    value: "0"
  - name: DB_HOST
    value: "rds.internal" # valid by default
```

Demo overlays patch these on via Kustomize JSON patches, matching the existing HPA patch pattern in [apps/backend/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml](apps/backend/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml). Prod overlay (when added) inherits the safe defaults — no risk of demo-mode leaking.

## Rollback paths (three of them, deliberate)

| Path                | Command                                                      | When to use                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In-flight abort     | `kubectl argo rollouts abort gitops-backend -n backend` | Rollout is paused or progressing and you want to stop it now. Returns traffic to stable, leaves new ReplicaSet at 0.                                                      |
| Post-promotion undo | `kubectl argo rollouts undo gitops-backend -n backend`  | Rollout has completed and you need to back out. **Drifts from Git** — ArgoCD will sync the bad version back unless self-heal is off. Emergency-only.                      |
| GitOps-canonical    | `git revert <image-bump-commit>` then push                   | Rollout has completed and the bug is confirmed. Restores desired state in Git, ArgoCD syncs the previous image. Auditable, reversible. **This is the production answer.** |

Scenario 3a's recovery uses path 3 (git revert). Path 2 is shown as the imperative escape hatch but called out as drift-inducing.

## What this design deliberately does not do

- **No prod tier.** Two clusters is enough to make the dev-vs-stage point. Prod would be a third overlay copying stage with manual promotion gates. Designed, not built.
- **No soak gating.** Soak testing — holding at 100% for hours/days post-promotion, watching SLOs, gating the next environment on the result — is a separate apparatus. Belongs between stage and prod. Designed, not built.
- **No automated rollback from alerts.** Alertmanager → auto-rollback is a known-hard problem (flapping alerts → flapping rollbacks). Alerts in this design notify humans; humans run `git revert`. This is the production-standard pattern.
- **No multi-metric AnalysisTemplate.** A real production setup would gate on success rate, latency p99, and error budget burn in addition to restart count. Single-metric analysis is sufficient to demonstrate the mechanism; tuning a multi-metric template is a depth exercise that doesn't add to the story.
- **No dev-side AnalysisTemplate.** Dev's job is fast feedback. Adding analysis to dev would either slow it down or be set so loose it'd catch nothing. The right answer is "dev accepts escape risk; stage catches what dev misses." That trade is the design.

## Build plan (one week)

| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Confirm preconditions: stage cluster registered with ArgoCD; Prometheus reachable from stage; Spring Boot OOM reproduces reliably with `IS_OOM=true OOM_AFTER_MINUTE=3` at 256Mi limit; stage overlay syncs today.                                                                   |
| 2   | Add `IS_OOM`, `OOM_AFTER_MINUTE`, `DB_HOST` env vars with safe defaults to [apps/backend/base/20_rollout.yaml](apps/backend/base/20_rollout.yaml). Patch dev and stage overlays to enable bug modes for the demo. Add `progressDeadlineSeconds` and `progressDeadlineAbort` per env. |
| 3   | Write AnalysisTemplate. Wire into stage rollout steps. Verify Prometheus service DNS from inside the stage cluster.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4   | Dry-run all three scenarios end-to-end on the live clusters. Tune timings if OOM doesn't land inside the canary window. Capture asciinema/screenshots of `kubectl argo rollouts get rollout -w` for each run.                                                                        |
| 5   | Draft README. Build the architecture diagram (built vs designed, solid vs dashed).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6   | Record + edit the 2-min video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7   | Polish README. Write the "what this deliberately does not do" section. Final pass. Push.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Day 1 is non-negotiable. If OOM doesn't reproduce reliably or Prometheus isn't reachable from stage, the rest of the plan is built on sand.

## Preconditions (day-1 checklist)

- [ ] Stage cluster registered with ArgoCD — `kubectl get secrets -n argocd -l argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type=cluster` shows it.
- [ ] Backend ApplicationSet ([bootstrap/900_app_backend.yaml](bootstrap/900_app_backend.yaml)) generates a stage Application — `kubectl get applications -n argocd` shows `app-900-backend` for stage.
- [ ] Prometheus reachable from inside the stage cluster — `kubectl run -n backend --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl curl-test -- curl http://prometheus-server.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090/-/ready` returns 200.
- [ ] `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total` metric exists — query it in the Prometheus UI before relying on it in the AnalysisTemplate.
- [ ] Spring Boot OOM fires within window — local docker run with `IS_OOM=true OOM_AFTER_MINUTE=3 -m 256m`, confirm OOMKill within 4-5 min.
- [ ] HPA on dev allows enough replicas — `maxReplicas: 2` may round 25% canary weight down to 0 pods. Bump to 4 for the demo if needed.

## Open design questions to resolve during build

1. **Bug 1 trigger mechanism.** Wrong `DB_HOST` is simplest. Alternative: a `BUG_RDS=true` flag in the app that throws on startup. Pick whichever requires the smallest app-side change.
2. **Should scenario 3a end with `git revert` on camera, or just describe it?** Recording the revert adds 30s to the video but completes the story. Decide during day-6 edit.
3. **AnalysisTemplate placement.** Currently in [apps/backend/base/](apps/backend/base/) and applied to all overlays via a stage-only patch, or in [apps/backend/overlays/stage/](apps/backend/overlays/stage/) directly. The latter is simpler; the former is more "production" (template lives with the app, environments toggle it on). Resolve on day 3.
